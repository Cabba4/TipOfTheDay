Topic SCP

# The SCP command, part of the SSH installation, provides remote file transfers via secure channel. It has virtually replaced the ftp command due to security reasons.  

# FTP allowed anonymous logins if not configured correctly so scp replaced it. 

SCP command can be used to send files from local to server and from server to local. Its a two way street.

The command usually looks like this

# Getting file from server to local 

scp username@host:/path/to/file/on/server /path/on/local/where/you/want/it

# Similarly in the opposite way it looks like

scp /path/to/local/file username@host:/path/to/save/location  

# You can also specify -r tag when downloading from server to local although not needed
