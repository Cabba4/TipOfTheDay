# Task - 1  

Tip of the day script

Description
The main task is to create a bash script that displays a different "Tip of the day" each time it is run. Configure your personal linux environment - use a test user at first to be sure the script wonâ€™t break anything - to run the script every time when entering the terminal of your own Linux host or taking a SSH connection to your personal Linux host.


The tips that your script show you can create yourself - you can use the tip cards you make in the previous exercise. Place the tips files to a separate folder. You can use either .txt or .md types of files - plain text or markdown formatting.


Moreover you have to add a README.md file to your repository that gives instructions for setting up any system for using the script. The README should also contain an example of how the script works - use proper formatting to show the example in the README file.
